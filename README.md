# Project 1 - Optimization of Monolithic and Ensemble Methods
##### PUCPR Â· PPGIa
###### Machine Learning | Q3 2017

#

##### 1. Test monolithic methods on [Wine] and [Liver Disorders] datasets from UCI repository. Use 10-fold cross-validation method. Algorithms to be tested and suggested parameters to be changed:

  - Decision Tree
    - Pruning
  - Naive Bayes
  - K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
    - Number K of neighbors
  - Multi Layer Perceptron (MLP)
    - Use only one hidden layer
    - Number of neurons
    - Percentage of dataset to validate
    - Number of epochs
  - Support Vector Machine (SVM)
    - Types of kernels

##### 2. Test emsemble methods to classify the datasets.

  - Bagging
    - Number of iterations
    - Bag size percentage
    - Number of classifiers
    - Type of classifiers
  - Boosting (AdaBoost)
    - Base classifier
    - Bag size percentage
  - Random Subspaces (RSS)
  - Random Forest (RS)
